# Econlite
Lightweight package providing very basic building blocks in computational economics. 

The reason for creating this package was that I wanted to avoid unnecessary repetition of things like: 

- Setting up a CRRA utility function 
- Setting up Cobb-Douglas/CES production function 

along with their derivatives and inverse functions of those derivatives. 

Alternatives of some tools here can be found at [QuantEcon.jl](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl).
